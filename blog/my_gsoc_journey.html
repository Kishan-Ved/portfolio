<div id="markdown-content"> <p>This blog post summarizes my open source experience, right from my very first open source contribution to getting selected for GSoC and completing my Google Summer of Code project!</p> <p><img src="../assets/img/GSoC_Logo.png" alt="alt text" width="100%"></p> <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1> <p>I am <b><a href="https://github.com/Kishan-Ved" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kishan Ved</a></b>, an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT Gandhinagar), India, in the department of Computer Science and Engineering. I spent the summer after my second year doing my Google Summer of Code 2024 project with the NumFOCUS organization (which serves as an umbrella organization for open source projects), which had Open Science Labs as a sub organization. The project I worked on is: <b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PyDataStructs</a></b>.</p> <h1 id="about-pydatastructs">About PyDataStructs</h1> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PyDataStructs</a></b> aims to be a Python package for various data structures in computer science. It also contains several algorithms including their parallel implementations. Everything is just a few calls away, and users don’t need to write any code from scratch. The APIs provided are consistent with each other, clean and easy to use. All implementations are well tested, 99% lines of code have already been tested by developers. PyDataStructs is the first well-designed library/package which covers most of the data structures and algorithms, with different backends like Python and C++.</p> <h1 id="my-first-contribution-to-open-source">My first contribution to open source</h1> <p>I began contributing to open source in December 2023, when I connected to a senior student at my university who had also done GSoC in 2023, with PyDataStructs. I was interested in the project that she did and hence I started exploring the codebase.</p> <h2 id="finding-a-good-first-issue">Finding a good first issue</h2> <p>I went to the issues tab on the repository’s github page and searched for good first issues. I noticed an issue that seemed doable: <b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/issues/545" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Implement Introsort</a></b>. This involved implementing the sorting algorithm: Introsort in the Python backend. I had learned this as a part of my academic cousework, and hence, I was able to code this.</p> <h2 id="my-first-pull-request">My first Pull Request</h2> <p>I started reading the README file and set up the repository locally and created the conda environment. Then I got to work. In a day, I was able to successfully create a PR (pull request) and open it on GitHub: <b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/549" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Implemented Introsort</a></b>. This PR was reviewed and changes were requested. Once I had done all of them and all the CI checks passed, it was merged. And that’s my first open souce contribution!</p> <h1 id="pre-gsoc-phase">Pre-GSoC Phase</h1> <p>Next, I connected to the maintainer, <b><a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gagandeep Singh</a></b>, and expressed my interest for contributing. He suggested that I contribute to more organizations, like: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LFortran</a></b> and <b><a href="https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LPython</a></b> to maximize my chances for GSoC. These organizations also had Gagandeep Sir as the core maintainer and developer.</p> <h2 id="the-amazing-open-source-community">The amazing open source community</h2> <p>I found the open source community amazing, everyone was ready to help me with every doubt I had, patiently guide me with differnt git commands to resolve conflicts and review my PRs and give valueable advice. I made new friends, who were almost of the same age as me, who had been contributing since quite a while. They made things easier for me and helped me contribute.</p> <h2 id="more-open-source-contributions">More open source contributions</h2> <p>I spent the next 3 months contributing to these organizations, and I had 10 merged PRs in the LFortran repository and 5 merged PRs in the LPython repository. Here’s a link to these:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AKishan-Ved+is%3Amerged" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LFortran contributions</a></b></p> </li> <li> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AKishan-Ved+is%3Amerged" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LPython contributions</a></b></p> </li> </ul> <p>These made me well versed with various git commands, the skill of handling a large and dynamic codebase and communicating effectively with the community to incorporate suggestions and solve issues.</p> <h2 id="drafting-my-gsoc-proposal">Drafting my GSoC proposal</h2> <p>Next, it was time to submit proposals for GSoC projects. By then, I had been contributing to open source for nearly 3 months. I requested a meeting with Gagandeep Sir to help me decide my proposal. He kindly agreed and we set up an online meeting, where we discussed potential GSoC ideas and the timeline that was best suited for me.</p> <p>I submitted 2 proposals, to LPython (Python Software Foundation) and PyDataStructs (NumFOCUS):</p> <ul> <li> <p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khpreH4pVJSj26VGJOf2v_XDCrOlo8qP/view?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NumFOCUS - Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add C++ Backend for all trees</a></b></p> </li> <li> <p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1to69uW9rb9vAE6pJCooamQo-Q1f_BYBt/view?usp=sharing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation - LPython: Implement modules from the Python Standard Library</a></b></p> </li> </ul> <p>The proposals should have personal information, details about previous open source contributions made to the organization’s repository, and detailed information about the project that you wish to take up, with a structured plan about your goals. In addition to this, it must contain an expected timeline that you will follow. It’s a good practice to set a large number of small goals and plan tasks before starting the project.</p> <h2 id="continuing-open-source-contributions">Continuing open source contributions</h2> <p>It’s a good practice to remain active in the organizations by contributing even after submitting GSoC proposals, this makes the developers believe that you are genuinely interested in the project and enthusiastic to contribute. This amplifies chances for getting selected for Google Summer of Code!</p> <h1 id="gsoc-phase">GSoC Phase</h1> <p>I got my acceptance letter at 11:32 pm IST on May 1, 2024. It was 2 minutes past the result declaration time and I was at the edge of my seat. I was overjoyed to get the mail saying I was accepted as a Google Summer of Code contributor for NumFOCUS! Here’s my project: <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/2nrxEFTg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add a C++ Backend for tree data structures and their algorithms</a></strong></p> <h2 id="my-gsoc-project-goals">My GSoC project goals</h2> <p>My project involved adding a C++ backend for all tree data structures in <strong><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PyDataStructs</a></strong>, a Python package for advanced data structures and algorithms. The user has an option to select either the Python backend or the C++ backend.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">tree</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">RedBlackTree</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">backend</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Backend</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CPP</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For any data structure, the Python backend is developed first, and once completely tested and ready, its C++ backend is developed. Both the backends share full functionality and are completely compatible. The C++ backend is extremely fast, it executes codes 8-10 times faster. This enhances the computation speed, making it extremely valuable for scientific computing and high-performance applications.</p> <h2 id="the-community-bonding-period">The community bonding period</h2> <p>I’ll be honest, it was difficult at the start. I found the project a little more difficult than I had anticipated, and realized that it demanded a little more that my current skillset. My mentor, Gagandeep Sir, adviced me to read the documentation and first learn about Python-C API, which was something totally new for me. I spent the first week doing this, and I could barely write any code. However, I soon realized the importance of reading the documentation and how smoothly things went following that. Within a week, I became well versed with all the new technology and started coding up my first PR.</p> <h2 id="coding-phase">Coding phase</h2> <p>I started working from the community bonding period itself, and this gave me a good headstart and allowed me to complete the project in 12 weeks. Here’s an outline of all the work I did:</p> <h3 id="pre-gsoc-work">Pre GSoC Work</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>PR Description</th> <th>Contribution</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/549" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: Added Introsort algorithm</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+127</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/553" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: Fixed version related bugs</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+4</span></strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="community-bonding-period">Community bonding period</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>PR Description</th> <th>Contribution</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/556" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Node, TreeNode, ArrayForTrees, BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree and all tree traversals implemented</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+1,936</span></strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="coding-phase-1">Coding Phase 1</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>PR Description</th> <th>Contribution</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/559" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Self Balancing Binary Tree</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+328</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/560" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Red Black Trees</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+748</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/561" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Binary Indexed Trees</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+179</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/562" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Splay Trees</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+423</span></strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="coding-phase-2">Coding Phase 2</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>PR Description</th> <th>Contribution</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/564" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for AVL Trees</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+488</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/567" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Cartesian Trees</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+254</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/568" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for Treap</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+150</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/569" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: C++ backend for all trees in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary_trees.py</code> file complete</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+72</span></strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/570" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PR: Updated Documentation</a></td> <td><strong><span style="color: green;">+12</span></strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <hr> <h2 id="contribution-stats">Contribution Stats:</h2> <p>Lines added: <strong><span style="color: green;">+4,721</span></strong> (#2 contributor in terms of lines added)</p> <p>Commits made: 12</p> <p>Total merged Pull Requests : 12</p> <p>Here’s a complete list of all my <strong><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3AKishan-Ved" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">merged PRs</a></strong></p> <h2 id="speed-results">Speed results</h2> <p>Time taken for methods of Binary Search Tree class to execute in different backends:</p> <p align="center"> <img src="https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b8fdf65-75d4-4636-aba1-525289c76615" alt="Centered Image"> </p> <p>The picture clearly indicates the utility of the C++ backend.
