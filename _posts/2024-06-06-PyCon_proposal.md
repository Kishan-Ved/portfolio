# Unleashing Python's Power: Lightning-fast speed with a C++ Backend
---

### Abstract
Python is an amazing programming language, because of it's simplicity, productivity and versatile ecosystem. However, when it comes to performance-critical tasks and numerical computing, the trade-off between ease of use and execution becomes a challenge. The solution to this: add a C++ backend! This retains all of Python's amazing functionality in the frontend and harnesses the lightning fast execution speed of C++. Experience the process of accelerating any Python code by adding a C++ backend.

### Description
PyDataStructs is an open source Python package for various data structures and algorithms, including their parallel implementations. As a part of Google Summer of Code 2024, I worked on adding a C++ backend for different tree data structures and their algorithms in PyDataStructs. This has greatly enhanced the speed of execution, making it 5-8 times faster. I have done this by extending Python with C++ using the Python C API. This allows the user to work in the simple and easy to understand Python frontend, while all the execution takes place in the C++ backend. The talk showcases the power of extending Python with C++ and provides an easy to understand demonstration of the same.

**Outline of the talk**

 - Introduction (2 minutes)
    - Welcome and a brief introduction of the speaker.
    - Overview of the talk's agenda and what the attendees can expect to learn.

**Expected Takeaways**
Attendees will walk away with a comprehensive understanding of Python C API's capabilities, its role in enhancing Python's performance, and the practical steps to extend their Python projects with C/C++. They will be inspired to leverage the strengths of adding a C++ backend for amazingly fast computations without sacrificing Python's user-friendly features.

### Speaker information
Kishan Ved is a third year student at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, India. He is pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

Kishan has contributed to Google Summer of Code 2024. He has developed open source software for NumFOCUS organization's project: PyDataStructs.

Being the Head Boy of his school, he has delivered a speech in a stadium, to an audience of 1000+ people, on the annual sports day. Here is a clip from the speech: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RtK_JPUGxIGHPMCT-JAw43ca922g0unf/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RtK_JPUGxIGHPMCT-JAw43ca922g0unf/view?usp=sharing)

### Pre-requisites
Basic knowledge of Python. A brief idea about C++  would be helpful (though not an absolute necessity).
