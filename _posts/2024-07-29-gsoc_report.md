# Google Summer of Code 2024 Report
This report summarizes the work done by me (**[Kishan Ved](https://github.com/Kishan-Ved)**) for **Google Summer of Code 2024** with the **NumFOCUS** organization, on the project **[Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add a C++ Backend for tree data structures and their algorithms](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/2nrxEFTg)**.
Weekly reports are available here: [GSoC BLogs](https://kishanved.tech/blog/)

This report is available as a GitHub Gist. [View here.](https://gist.github.com/Kishan-Ved/ebe0a971220d67517ae815e4f92d2459)

## About me
I am Kishan Ved, an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT Gandhinagar), India, in the department of Computer Science and Engineering.

## Project Goals
My project involved adding a C++ backend for all tree data structures in [PyDataStructs](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs), a Python package for advanced data structures and algorithms. The user has an option to select either the Python backend or the C++ backend.

```python
tree = RedBlackTree(backend=Backend.CPP)
```

For any data structure, the Python backend is developed first, and once completely tested and ready, its C++ backend is developed. Both the backends share full functionality and are completely compatible. The C++ backend is extremely fast, it executes codes 8-10 times faster. This enhances the computation speed, making it extremely valuable for scientific computing and high-performance applications.

## Project Outline
I started working from the community bonding period itself, and this gave me a good headstart and allowed me to complete the project in 12 weeks. Here's an outline of all the work I did:

## Weekly reports
My Google Summer of Code blogs are available on my website: [https://kishanved.tech/blog/](https://kishanved.tech/blog/)

## Future work
Some issues have been opened, these can be addressed. Refer PyDataStructs Wiki on GitHub for upcoming plans.

## Learnings

**Tech**: Mastered the art of linking a Python code to a C++ backend by using the Python-C API to improve speeds greatly. Polished my C++ and Python coding skills.

**GitHub**: Learned various new commands, resolution of conflicts and merging branches for collaborative work.

**Perseverance**: GSoC taught me to read the documentation, be calm and perseverant. It's difficult at the start but smoother ahead!
