## C++ backend for Treap done!

---
### <ins>Coding info</ins>


This week, I finished coding up the `C++ backend for Treap`. The following methods were implemented:
- `Treap___new__()`
- `Treap___str__()`
- `Treap_search()`
- `Treap_insert()`
- `Treap_delete()`

### <ins>Relevant PRs:</ins>

PR for C++ backend for Treap (merged): [#568](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/568)

In the following week, I will add some additional functionality (like a few getter functions to access values and linking base class functions to derived classes) and this will complete the entire C++ backend for all trees present in `binary_trees.py` file.

### <ins>Learnings/Difficulties</ins>

All going great!
