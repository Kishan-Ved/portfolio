## C++ backend for Node, TreeNode and ArrayForTrees

---
### <ins>Coding info</ins>

In my second week of GSoC, I have worked on coding up the C++ backend for 3 classes: Node, TreeNode and ArrayForTrees. The backend follows the structure in their Python implementations. These C++ classes' objects can now be called in the Binary Trees class. 

### <ins>Relevant PRs:</ins>

I worked on the PR: [#556](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/556)

Important commits include:
- [C++ backend for Node class](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/556/commits/46a65cf9d96f2405bc901e649ac2b31afd8efc3a)
- [C++ backend for TreeNode class](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/556/commits/da8fb74b5443c5ae7867d5cdbf473b073597e8e7)
- [C++ backend for ArrayForTrees class](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/556/commits/0665403a539f00d533df86458abccb60e654193d)

There have been a large number of commits, these involve addition of C++ backend for Node class, TreeNode class (which has Node as it's base class) and ArrayForTrees class (which has DynamicOneDimensionalArray as it's base class). Other commits fix errors and segfaults encountered and have code quality corrections.

In the following week, I will test all the code in this PR. It will be tested against the existing test cases and I will add more tests, covering edge cases that might occur. I will also add code to redirect control to this C++ backend (from Python), when the necessary backend parameter is passed.

### <ins>Learnings/Difficulties</ins>

I learned how to define the "parent class and child class" structure in Python-C API, inheritance from the super class and making objects of a class using Python-C API. Thanks to my mentor, [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807) for resolving the issues I faced.

See you next week with more updates! :)
