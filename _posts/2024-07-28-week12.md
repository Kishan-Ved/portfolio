##### `[July 22 - July 28]`

## Completing Google Summer of Code 2024!

---
### <ins>Coding info</ins>

This week, I wrapped up all my pending work, and I have successfully completed my Google Summer of Code 2024 project. I have fully implemented the C++ backend for all tree data structures present in the `binary_trees.py` file.

I made a PR involving Final additions to complete C++ backend for all trees in binary_trees.py file. Added getter functions to access root_idx (index of the root) for all tree types.

I also made my final GSoC 2024 report: **[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/Kishan-Ved/ebe0a971220d67517ae815e4f92d2459)**

### <ins>Relevant PRs:</ins>

PR for C++ backend for all trees in binary_trees.py file complete (merged): [#569](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/569)

For next week... **Hey wait, I finished the project! Yay!**

### <ins>Learnings/Difficulties</ins>

GSoC has been an amazing experience, I've learned so much and enjoyed my summer holiday. It was great being a part of this wonderful program and I am truly happy with how well I navigated through the project and completed it successfully.

<br>
Thanks to my mentor, [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807), for being an amazing mentor. Thanks to [Ivan Ogasawara](https://github.com/xmnlab) and the team at Open Science Labs and NumFOCUS.

See you again with some more interesting stuff that I'll do! (Hopefully another GSoC next year!)

Happily ending GSoC 2024,
