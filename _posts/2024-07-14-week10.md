## First GSoC Evaluation Passed Successfully!

### <ins>Coding info</ins>


This week, I finished coding up the `C++ backend for Cartesian Trees`. The following methods were implemented:
- `CartesianTree___new__()`
- `CartesianTree___str__()`
- `CartesianTree_search()`
- `CartesianTree__bubble_up()`
- `CartesianTree__trickle_down()`
- `CartesianTree_insert()`
- `CartesianTree_delete()`
- `CartesianTree_root_idx()` : A getter function.

Comprehensive tests were added and I ensured that all of them passed. 

### <ins>Relevant PRs:</ins>

PR for C++ backend for Cartesian Trees (merged): [#562](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/567)

In the following week, I will implement Treap in the C++ backend.

### <ins>Learnings/Difficulties</ins>

This week, I learned about getter and setter functions and their implementation using the Python-C API. I created a getter function `CartesianTree_root_idx()` that accesses a member from a class much above in hierarchy (parent->parent->parent class).

Thanks to my mentor, [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807), for his support throughout.

See you again after an awesome week! 😊
