### <ins>Coding info</ins>

This week, I coded up the C++ backend for Splay Trees. The following methods were implemented:
- `SplayTree__zig()`
- `SplayTree__zig_zig()`
- `SplayTree__zig_zag()`
- `SplayTree__zag_zag()`
- `SplayTree__zag_zig()`
- `SplayTree_splay()`
- `SplayTree_insert()`
- `SplayTree_delete()`

### <ins>Relevant PRs:</ins>

PR for SplayTrees (work in progress): [#562](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/562)

In the following week, I will finish implementing Splay Trees in the C++ backend. Then, I will start making the C++ backend for the next tree data structure.

### <ins>Learnings/Difficulties</ins>

I encountered some segmentation faults, and I used print statements to figure out the exact line where they occured. Used a little DSA here, did a binary search on the code to find the error :) .

Thanks to my mentor, [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807), for his support throughout.

See you again after a productive week! 😊
