##### `[June 10 - June 16]`

## My fingers code faster than I can think!

### <ins>Coding info</ins>

In the first half of this week, I completed the `Red Black Trees` class. In the second half, I worked on `Binary Indexed Trees` (which can also be interpreted as `Fenwick Trees`).

For Red Black Trees, the following methods have been implemented in the C++ backend, and tested exhaustively:
- `insert()`
  - `_get_parent()`
  - `_get_grand_parent()`
  - `_get_sibling()`
  - `_get_uncle()`
  - `_is_onleft()`
  - `_is_onright()`
  - `__fix_insert()`
- `delete()`
  - `_find_predecessor()`
  - `_transplant_values()`
  - `_has_one_child()`
  - `_is_leaf()`
  - `_has_two_child()`
  - `__has_red_child()`
  - `_replace_node()`
  - `__walk1_walk_isblack()`
  - `__left_left_siblingcase()`
  - `__right_left_siblingcase()`
  - `__left_right_siblingcase()`
  - `__right_right_siblingcase()`
  - `__fix_deletion()`
  - `_remove_node()`
  - `_delete_root()`
  - `__leaf_case()`
  - `__one_child_case()`
  - `__two_child_case()`
- All tree traversals (**OOPS concepts used to resuse code**)
  
For Binary Indexed Trees, I've implemented the following methods in the C++ backend:
- `update()`
- `get_prefix_sum()`
- `get_sum()`

PR for RedBlackTrees (merged): [#560](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/560)

PR for BinaryIndexedTrees (merged): [#561](https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/561)

In the following week, I will implement AVL Trees in the C++ backend.

### <ins>Learnings/Difficulties</ins>

Everything is now going smoothly! My fingers code faster than I can think! I've understood the process and now become good at it, yay.

Thanks to my mentor, [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807), for his support throughout.

See you again after an amazing week! 😊
