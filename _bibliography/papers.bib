      abstract={Scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large-scale graphs. To tackle this, coarsening-based methods are used to reduce the graph into a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during both training and inference phases. We demonstrate two different methods (Extra-Nodes and Cluster-Nodes). Our study also proposes a unique application of the coarsening algorithm for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression, which have not yet been explored. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets in the order of 100K nodes to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in tasks involving classification and regression on nodes and graphs, compared to traditional GNNs, while having single-node inference times that are orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, our approach significantly reduces memory consumption, allowing training and inference on lowresource devices where traditional methods struggle.},
