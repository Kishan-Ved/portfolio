I spent the summer after my second year doing my Google Summer of Code 2024 project with the NumFOCUS organization (which serves as an umbrella organization for open source projects), which had Open Science Labs as a sub organization. The project I worked on is: <b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs">PyDataStructs</a></b>.</p> <h1 id="about-pydatastructs">About PyDataStructs</h1> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs">PyDataStructs</a></b> aims to be a Python package for various data structures in computer science. It also contains several algorithms including their parallel implementations. Everything is just a few calls away, and users don’t need to write any code from scratch. The APIs provided are consistent with each other, clean and easy to use. All implementations are well tested, 99% lines of code have already been tested by developers. PyDataStructs is the first well-designed library/package which covers most of the data structures and algorithms, with different backends like Python and C++.</p> <h1 id="my-first-contribution-to-open-source">My first contribution to open source</h1> <p>I began contributing to open source in December 2023, when I connected to a senior student at my university who had also done GSoC in 2023, with PyDataStructs. I was interested in the project that she did and hence I started exploring the codebase.</p> <h2 id="finding-a-good-first-issue">Finding a good first issue</h2> <p>I went to the issues tab on the repository’s github page and searched for good first issues. I noticed an issue that seemed doable: <b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/issues/545">Implement Introsort</a></b>. This involved implementing the sorting algorithm: Introsort in the Python backend. I had learned this as a part of my academic cousework, and hence, I was able to code this.</p> <h2 id="my-first-pull-request">My first Pull Request</h2> <p>I started reading the README file and set up the repository locally and created the conda environment. Then I got to work. In a day, I was able to successfully create a PR (pull request) and open it on GitHub: <b><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs/pull/549">Implemented Introsort</a></b>. This PR was reviewed and changes were requested. Once I had done all of them and all the CI checks passed, it was merged. And that’s my first open souce contribution!</p> <h1 id="pre-gsoc-phase">Pre-GSoC Phase</h1> <p>Next, I connected to the maintainer, <b><a href="https://github.com/czgdp1807">Gagandeep Singh</a></b>, and expressed my interest for contributing. He suggested that I contribute to more organizations, like: <b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran">LFortran</a></b> and <b><a href="https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython">LPython</a></b> to maximize my chances for GSoC. These organizations also had Gagandeep Sir as the core maintainer and developer.</p> <h2 id="the-amazing-open-source-community">The amazing open source community</h2> <p>I found the open source community amazing, everyone was ready to help me with every doubt I had, patiently guide me with differnt git commands to resolve conflicts and review my PRs and give valueable advice. I made new friends, who were almost of the same age as me, who had been contributing since quite a while. They made things easier for me and helped me contribute.</p> <h2 id="more-open-source-contributions">More open source contributions</h2> <p>I spent the next 3 months contributing to these organizations, and I had 10 merged PRs in the LFortran repository and 5 merged PRs in the LPython repository. Here’s a link to these:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AKishan-Ved+is%3Amerged">LFortran contributions</a></b></p> </li> <li> <p><b><a href="https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AKishan-Ved+is%3Amerged">LPython contributions</a></b></p> </li> </ul> <p>These made me well versed with various git commands, the skill of handling a large and dynamic codebase and communicating effectively with the community to incorporate suggestions and solve issues.</p> <h2 id="drafting-my-gsoc-proposal">Drafting my GSoC proposal</h2> <p>Next, it was time to submit proposals for GSoC projects. By then, I had been contributing to open source for nearly 3 months. I requested a meeting with Gagandeep Sir to help me decide my proposal. He kindly agreed and we set up an online meeting, where we discussed potential GSoC ideas and the timeline that was best suited for me.</p> <p>I submitted 2 proposals, to LPython (Python Software Foundation) and PyDataStructs (NumFOCUS):</p> <ul> <li> <p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khpreH4pVJSj26VGJOf2v_XDCrOlo8qP/view?usp=sharing">NumFOCUS - Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add C++ Backend for all trees</a></b></p> </li> <li> <p><b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1to69uW9rb9vAE6pJCooamQo-Q1f_BYBt/view?usp=sharing">Python Software Foundation - LPython: Implement modules from the Python Standard Library</a></b></p> </li> </ul> <p>The proposals should have personal information, details about previous open source contributions made to the organization’s repository, and detailed information about the project that you wish to take up, with a structured plan about your goals. In addition to this, it must contain an expected timeline that you will follow. It’s a good practice to set a large number of small goals and plan tasks before starting the project.</p> <h2 id="continuing-open-source-contributions">Continuing open source contributions</h2> <p>It’s a good practice to remain active in the organizations by contributing even after submitting GSoC proposals, this makes the developers believe that you are genuinely interested in the project and enthusiastic to contribute. This amplifies chances for getting selected for Google Summer of Code!</p> <h1 id="gsoc-phase">GSoC Phase</h1> <p>I got my acceptance letter at 11:32 pm IST on May 1, 2024. It was 2 minutes past the result declaration time and I was at the edge of my seat. I was overjoyed to get the mail saying I was accepted as a Google Summer of Code contributor for NumFOCUS! Here’s my project: <strong><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/2nrxEFTg">Open Science Labs: PyDataStructs: Add a C++ Backend for tree data structures and their algorithms</a></strong></p> <h2 id="my-gsoc-project-goals">My GSoC project goals</h2> <p>My project involved adding a C++ backend for all tree data structures in <strong><a href="https://github.com/codezonediitj/pydatastructs">PyDataStructs</a></strong>, a Python package for advanced data structures and algorithms. The user has an option to select either the Python backend or the C++ backend.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">tree</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">RedBlackTree</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">backend</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">Backend</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CPP</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For any data structure, the Python backend is developed first, and once completely tested and ready, its C++ backend is developed. Both the backends share full functionality and are completely compatible. The C++ backend is extremely fast, it executes codes 8-10 times faster. This enhances the computation speed, making it extremely valuable for scientific computing and high-performance applications.</p> <h2 id="the-community-bonding-period">The community bonding period</h2> <p>I’ll be honest, it was difficult at the start. I found the project a little more difficult than I had anticipated, and realized that it demanded a little more that my current skillset. My mentor, Gagandeep Sir, adviced me to read the documentation and first learn about Python-C API, which was something totally new for me. I spent the first week doing this, and I could barely write any code. However, I soon realized the importance of reading the documentation and how smoothly things went following that. Within a week, I became well versed with all the new technology and started coding up my first PR.</p> <h2 id="coding-phase">Coding phase</h2> <p>I started working from the community bonding period itself, and this gave me a good headstart and allowed me to complete the project in 12 weeks.

Here is the breakdown of the code:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Imports:</strong> The necessary libraries such as PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib, urllib, numpy, sklearn, einops, and warnings are imported. All of these libraries are necessary for the code to run.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Loading the Image:</strong> The image of a dog as mentioned in the question is taken form the instructer’s code and read using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torchvision.io.read_image</code> function. The image is then displayed using matplotlib.</p> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/ori_dog.png" alt="dog_img" width="80%"/> </div> <p>+</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Scaling the RGB Values:</strong> The RGB values of the image are scaled from 0 to 1 using Min-Max scaler from the sklearn.preprocessing module. The formula for scaling the RGB values is given by:</p> <p><strong>[ X_{scaled} = \frac{X_{max}-X}{X_{max}-X_{min}} ]</strong><br/> where ( X_{max} ) and ( X_{min} ) are the maximum and minimum values of the RGB channels, respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cropping the Image:</strong> Due to the memory constraints, the size of the target image we took is 100 x 100. The image is cropped to this size using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">torchvision.transforms.functional.crop</code> function.</p> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog100.png" alt="dog_img" width="60%"/> </div> <p align="center">Cropped Image (100 x 100)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Creating Coordinate Map:</strong> A function is defined to create a coordinate map for the original image. The coordinate map consists of coordinates and corresponding to the pixel values of all the three channels (R G B).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Training the Linear Model:</strong> Another function is defined to train a linear model on the random Fourier features extracted from the coordinate map after scaling it. The model is trained using mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Plotting Original vs. Enhanced Image:</strong> A function is defined to plot the original image and the enhanced image side by side.</p> </li> <li><strong>Enhancing the Image:</strong> An overall function that takes the original image, number of random Fourier features, sigma (kernel width for RBF sampler), learning rate, and number of epochs as input. It then creates random Fourier features, trains the linear model, and plots the original and enhanced images. <ul> <li> <p>The general equation for the Fourier basis functions can be expressed as follows:</p> <p><strong>For sine basis functions: [ \psi_k(x) = \sin(k \omega x + b_k) ]</strong></p> <p><strong>For cosine basis functions: [ \phi_k(x) = \cos(k \omega x + b_k) ]</strong></p> <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>( k ) is the frequency index,</li> <li>( \omega ) is the angular frequency,</li> <li>( x ) is the input variable,</li> <li>( b_k ) is a randomly generated phase offset. (\newline)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The bandwidth parameter <strong>( \sigma )</strong> influences the spread or width of the basis functions indirectly through the angular frequency <strong>( \omega )</strong>. Typically, <strong>( \omega = \frac{1}{\sigma} )</strong>. However, the direct inclusion of <strong>( \sigma )</strong> in the equation for Fourier basis functions is less common, as <strong>( \sigma )</strong> primarily affects the kernel function used in kernel methods rather than the basis functions themselves.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Enhancing the Image for Different Sigmas:</strong> The image is enhanced for different values of sigma for finding the better sigma (kernel width for RBF Sampler, it represents the bandwidth parameter of the fourier basis used for feature mapping), and the enhanced images are stored in a list. <ul> <li>For <strong>( \sigma )</strong> = 0.1</li> </ul> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_sigma01.png" alt="dog_img" width="50%"/> </div> <ul> <li>For <strong>( \sigma )</strong> = 0.04</li> </ul> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_sigma04.png" alt="dog_img" width="50%"/> </div> <ul> <li>For <strong>( \sigma )</strong> = 0.001</li> </ul> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_sigma001.png" alt="dog_img" width="50%"/> </div> <p>As you can see for higher <strong>( \sigma )</strong> values, the model is creating less complex decision boundaries and is not able to capture the fine details of the image. On the other hand, for lower <strong>( \sigma )</strong> values, the model is creating more complex decision boundaries and is able to capture the fine details of the image but further decreasing the <strong>( \sigma )</strong> value will lead to overfitting and the model will not be able to generalize well on the test data. This we can see in the image with <strong>( \sigma )</strong> = 0.001, the model has high variance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Output:</strong> The comparison between the low-resolution image and the enhanced image is displayed for each sigma value. On comparison it is found that the image with the sigma value of around 0.04 gives the best results.</p> <ul> <li>For <strong>( \sigma )</strong> = 0.04</li> </ul> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_sigma04.png" alt="dog_img" width="50%"/> </div> </li> </ol> <p>The code effectively demonstrates Super-Resolution using a linear model trained on Random Fourier Features. It provides a qualitative comparison between the original and enhanced images, showing how the resolution is improved. Additionally, it allows experimenting with different values of sigma to observe their effects on the enhanced image over different bandwidths of the fourier basis used for feature mapping. We will also see the quantitative analysis in the next part of the question which will allow us to evaluate the performance of the super-resolution technique using RMSE and PSNR.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>The quality of the output image depends on the choice of sigma (kernel width for RBF sampler) and the number of random Fourier features used, which can be further optimized using Hyperparameter Tuning.</em></p> <h3 id="b-quantitative-analysis">$B.$ Quantitative Analysis</h3> <p>The study can be further improved by adding quantitative analysis to evaluate the performance of the super-resolution technique. This can be done by calculating and comparing metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the Original $N$ x $N$ Image and Enhance $N$ x $N$ Image from $N/2$ x $N/2$ Image. Here is the breakdown of the code:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Original Image (400 x 400):</strong><br/> The original image is the cropped image of size 400 x 400 pixels. This serves as the ground truth for comparison.</p> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_ground_truth.png" alt="dog_img" width="70%"/> </div> <p align="center">Ground Truth Image (400 x 400)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low-Resolution Image (200 x 200):</strong><br/> The original image is downsampled using 2D convolution to create a low-resolution image with dimensions of 200 x 200 pixels.</p> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_lowres.png" alt="dog_img" width="70%"/> </div> <p align="center">Low-Resolution Image (200 x 200)</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Generating Random Fourier Features:</strong><br/> Random Fourier features are generated for the scaled coordinates of the low-resolution image using the RBF Sampler. training a linear model on these features to learn the mapping from low to high resolution.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Training the Linear Model on RFF:</strong> The Linear Model has input features equal to the Random Fourier Features and the output features equal to the RGB values of the original image i.e, 3. The model is trained using mean squared error loss and Adam optimizer.</p> </li> <li><strong>Enhanced Image (400 x 400):</strong><br/> The learned model is then applied to the coordinate map of the low-resolution image to generate an enhanced version with dimensions of 400 x 400 pixels. <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/pred_dog.png" alt="dog_img" width="70%"/> </div> <p>[The image here formed is made with the sigma value of 0.03 and number of random Fourier features as 10000. As the 10000 features are not able to represent the data properly, the image is not enhanced properly and is not very comparable to the original image. This can be improved by increasing the number of random Fourier features which requires more computation and memory.]</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Quantitative Metrics:</strong> The mean squared error (RMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are calculated to quantitatively assess the similarity between the original and enhanced images. These metrics provide objective measures of the quality of the enhancement. The formulas for RMSE and PSNR are as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): [ RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - y_i)^2} ] where ( N ) is the total number of pixels in the image, ( x_i ) is the pixel value of the original image, and ( y_i ) is the pixel value of the enhanced image. We will calculate RMSE for each channel (R, G, B) and then take the sum of the three values.</p> </li> <li> <p>Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): [ PSNR = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{MAX_I}{\sqrt{MSE}}\right) ] where ( MAX_I ) is the maximum possible pixel value (1.0 for scaled pixels values) and ( MSE ) is the mean squared error between the original and enhanced images.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Output:</strong> The RMSE and PSNR values that we got from the above calculations are as follows: <ul> <li>RMSE: 0.05166782811284065</li> <li>PSNR: 25.73858642578125</li> </ul> <p>The high PSNR value indicates that the enhanced image is very similar to the original image, and the low RMSE value further confirms this. The quantitative analysis provides a more objective evaluation of the super-resolution technique, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of the method in improving image resolution while preserving important features.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, this approach allows for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the super-resolution technique. By comparing the original and enhanced images and calculating RMSE and PSNR, it provides insights into the effectiveness of the method in improving image resolution while preserving important features.</p> <h3 id="c-reconstruction-of-the-image">$C.$ Reconstruction of the Image</h3> <p>In this part, we randomly remove data from an image and then reconstruct it using random fourier features and linear regression.</p> <p>The following is the actual image:</p> <div align="center"> <img src="./Ques4Img/dog_ground_truth.png" alt="dog_img" width="70%"/> </div> <p>Now, we will randomly remove data from this image and reconstruct it.
